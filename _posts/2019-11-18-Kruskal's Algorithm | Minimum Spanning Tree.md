title: "Kruskal's Algorithm | Minimum Spanning Tree"
subtitle: "When edges connects all vertices in a graph and form a tree then it is known as *spanning tree*. While connecting edges no cycle should be formed.  A minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible."
