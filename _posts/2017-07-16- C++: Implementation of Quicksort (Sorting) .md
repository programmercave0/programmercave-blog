title: "Quicksort | C++ Implementation"
subtitle: "The algorithm selects an element as pivot. The input array is divided into two subarrays. All elements in left subarray are less than pivot and all elements in right subarray are greater than pivot. These two subarrays are sorted independently and then merged to form a single sorted array."
