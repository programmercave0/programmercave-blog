title: "Depth First Search using Adjacency List | Graph traversal"
subtitle: "Depth first search explores on a single path in a graph as long as it find undiscovered vertices. When an edge leads to the discovered vertices it backtrack to the previous vertex and explores along the edge where it find undiscovered vertices. Finally it backtracks to the source vertex from where it started. "
