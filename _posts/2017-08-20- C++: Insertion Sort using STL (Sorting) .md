title: "Insertion Sort | C++ Implementation"
subtitle: "Insertion sort is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements. The algorithm selects an element from the unsorted array and put it in the proper position in the sorted. This process is repeated until all elements in the array are sorted.  The sorting is in-place means array consists of sorted portion and unsorted portion in it."
