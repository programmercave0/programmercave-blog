subtitle: "You have to output the order of succession to the British throne of a list of given people. The order is simple:
From a descendant A, the next in the order is A’s first child B.
Then, the next one is B’s first child C if any and so on.
If C has no child, then the next one is B’s second child D.
Then D’s children if any. Then B’s third child E… then A’s second child F"
