title: "Single Elevator Simulation in C++"
subtitle: "Here we are going to implement the Single Elevator Simulation in C++. Initially the elevator is at ground floor. It is represented by 0. Floors below ground floor are represented by negative integers.The elevator has maximum capacity it can carry, maximum and minimum floor it can carry to.The elevator accepts the request of floor the passengers want to go. If the elevator is empty then the first request sets the direction of the elevator. After that it checks whether requests are valid. For eg. if the direction of elevator is UP, current floor is 3 and if the passenger enters request for floor -1 then the request is discarded and the passenger does not enter in the elevator."
