title: "Dijkstra's Algorithm | Single-Source Shortest Path"
subtitle: "Dijkstra's algorithm finds shortest paths from the source vertex to all vertices in the graph. The condition for the algorithm is that all edge weights should be non-negative. Thus, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is efficient than the Bellman-Ford algorithm because it processes each edge only once, since it knows that there are no negative-weight edges in the graph."
