title: "Merge Sort | C++ Implementation"
subtitle: "Merge sort follows *divide-and-conquer* approach. It divides an array of n elements into two subarrays of n/2 elements each. Then it sort the two subarrays recursively using merge sort. And then these subarrays are merged to produce a single sorted array."
