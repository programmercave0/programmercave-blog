subtitle: "In a database management system, triggers are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to specific database events, such as insert, update, or delete operations on a table. Triggers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as enforcing data integrity rules, logging changes to a table, or sending notifications when certain events occur."
