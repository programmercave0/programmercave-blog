## Constructor

- special method that is called when an object is created. 
- used to initialize the object. 
- called automatically when the object is created. 
- used to set initial values for object attributes.
- **it's a method, but it has no return type**
- **implicitly returns the type of the object that it creates**

**Syntax of a constructor**

- In Java, Constructor declarations begin with access modifiers: They can be public, private, protected, or package access, based on other access modifiers. 
- Unlike methods, a constructor can't be abstract, static, final, native, or synchronized.

### Types of Constructor

#### Default constructor
- constructor created by the compiler if we do not define any constructor(s) for a class. 

#### Parameterized constructor
-  real benefit of constructors is that they help us maintain encapsulation when injecting state into the object.

## Access modifiers
- There are two types of modifiers in Java: **access modifiers** and **non-access modifiers**.

### Types of access modifiers in Java
- **public** - The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package
- **protected** - The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package. 
- **private** - The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
- **default** - The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

| Modifier  | Class | Package | Subclass | Global |
| --------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| Public    | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | Yes    |
| Protected | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | No     |
| Default   | Yes   | Yes     | No       | No     |
| Private   | Yes   | No      | No       | No     |

## Inheritance
-  mechanism that allows one class to acquire all the properties from another class by inheriting the class.
- represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

### Types of inheritance
 - **Single** - when a class can have only one parent class.
 - **Multilevel** - when a class can have multiple parent classes at different levels.
 - **Hierarchical** - When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance.
 - **Multiple** - When a class can have multiple parent classes, it is known as multiple inheritance.

## Diamond Problem

- ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C.
-  If there is a method in A that B and C have overridden, and D does not override it, then which version of the method does D inherit: that of B, or that of C.

## Java Code

User.java
```java
package com.scaler.lld.scaler;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter
@Setter
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public void changeEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    public void printInfo() {
    }

    public void printInfo(String title) {
        System.out.println(" \n User: " + title + " " + this.getName());
    }
}
```

Student.java
```java
package com.scaler.lld.scaler;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter
@Setter
public class Student extends User {

    private String batchName;
    private Integer psp;
    private StudentStatus status = StudentStatus.ACTIVE; // ACTIVE, PAUSED, COMPLETED

    // Define parametrised constructor

    public Student(String name, String email, String batchName, Integer psp) {
        super(name, email);
        this.batchName = batchName;

        if (psp < 0 || psp > 100) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("PSP should be between 0 and 100");
        }
        this.psp = psp;
    }

    public Student() {
    }

    void changeBatch(String batchName) {
        this.batchName = batchName;
    }

    @Override
    public void printInfo() {
        System.out.println("\nStudent: " + getName() + " " + getBatchName());
    }

}
```

StudentStatus.java
```java
package com.scaler.lld.scaler;

public enum StudentStatus {
    ACTIVE, PAUSED, COMPLETED, EDGE
}
```

Mentor.java
```java
package com.scaler.lld.scaler;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter
@Setter
public class Mentor extends User {
    private List<Student> mentees = new ArrayList<>();
    private String company;

    public Mentor(String name, String email, List<Student> mentees, String company) {
        super(name, email);
        this.mentees = mentees;
        this.company = company;
    }
}
```

App.java
```java
package com.scaler.lld;

import java.util.List;
import com.scaler.lld.scaler.Student;
import com.scaler.lld.scaler.User;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        User student = new Student("student", "student@scaler.in", "batch", 100);
        student.printInfo(); // inheritance
    }

    public static void resetEmail(List<User> users) {
        for (User user : users) {
            user.changeEmail("");

            if (user instanceof Student) {
                Student student = (Student) user;

                System.out.println("Name :" + student.getName() + " " + student.getPsp());

                student.setPsp(0);
                System.out.println("Name :" + student.getName() + " " + student.getPsp());

            }            

        }

    }
}
