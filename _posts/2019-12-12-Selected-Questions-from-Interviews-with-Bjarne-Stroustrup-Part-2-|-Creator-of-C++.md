title: "Selected Questions from Interviews with Bjarne Stroustrup Part 2| Creator of C++"
subtitle: "Why did you choose C as the language to add object oriented features of Simula? There were a few Procedural languages like COBOL, PASCAL to add OO Features. Also Your favorite language was Algol68.Bjarne: I knew quite a few languages at the time, maybe 25 or thereabouts. It was easier to learn languages at that time. They were not as big or complicated, and their implementations were not so complicated. Algol68 was quite a beautiful language, very elegant.The reason I chose C was that I needed to manipulate hardware. I needed to write things like schedulers, memory allocators, device drivers."
