title: "Library Fine | HackerRank"
subtitle: "Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows: 
 • If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0).
 • If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, fine = 15 Hackos * (the number of days late).
 • If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine = 500 Hackos * (the number of months late). 
 • If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 Hackos."
