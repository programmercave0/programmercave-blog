title: "Left Rotation - HackerRank | C++ Implementation"
subtitle: "A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then the array would become  [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]. Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers."
