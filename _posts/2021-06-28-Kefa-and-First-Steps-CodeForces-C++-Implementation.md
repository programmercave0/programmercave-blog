title: "Kefa and First Steps - CodeForces | C++ Implementation"
subtitle: "Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly *n* days. He knows that on the *i*-th day (1≤*i*≤n) he makes *a<sub>i</sub>* money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence *a<sub>i</sub>*. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order."
