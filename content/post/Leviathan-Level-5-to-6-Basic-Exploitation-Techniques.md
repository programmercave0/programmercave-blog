Learn linux command by playing [Leviathan](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/) wargame from OverTheWire. This wargame doesn't require any knowledge about programming - just a bit of common sense and some knowledge about basic *nix commands.

Below is the solution of Level 5 → Level 6 and Level 6 → Level 7. In this post we will learn how to use a debugging tool **ltrace** to exploit a program and how to bruteforce password.

## [Leviathan Level 5 → Level 6](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/leviathan6.html)

Command to login is `ssh leviathan5@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223` and password is  `Tith4cokei` .

There is a binary file *leviathan5* in the home directory. When we execute it, the output is “*Cannot find /tmp/file.log*”. Using `ltrace` we found that is opens the file */tmp/file.log*.

If we make the file */tmp/file.log* a symbolic link to */etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6* then we can see the password. The command to do that is `ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log`. Then executing the binary will reveal the password and the password is `UgaoFee4li` .

## [Leviathan Level 6 → Level 7](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/leviathan7.html)

Command to login is `ssh leviathan6@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223` and password is  `UgaoFee4li` .

In the home directory we have a binary file *leviathan6*. When we execute it, the output says we need to enter 4 digit pin. We can bruteforce the 4 digit pin like we did in [Bandit level 24](/Bandit-Level-24-Level-25-OverTheWire).

We can bruteforce using command 
```
for i in $(seq 0000 9999); do ./leviathan6 $i ; done
```

This logs us in as leviathan7 and we can check using command `whoami`.

Then we can see the password for next level using `cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan7` and the password is  `ahy7MaeBo9` .
