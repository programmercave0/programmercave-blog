### Introduction

Go manages memory for you, but understanding *how* it does this is key to writing efficient, high-performance code. Every value in your program is stored in one of two places: the **stack** or the **heap**.

---

### The Stack: Fast, Simple, and Temporary

The stack is a simple, highly efficient region of memory used for function calls and their local variables.

**Analogy:** Think of the stack as a **stack of plates**.
*   When you call a function, you place a new plate on top (a "stack frame").
*   This plate holds all the local variables for that function.
*   When the function finishes, you take its plate off the top.
*   This is a strict **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** process.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Extremely Fast:** Allocation is trivialâ€”it's just moving a pointer to the top of the stack. Deallocation is equally fast.
*   **Self-Cleaning:** Memory is automatically reclaimed when a function returns. You don't need a garbage collector for the stack.
*   **Fixed Size (per Goroutine):** Each goroutine gets its own small stack (initially 2KB). It can grow if needed, but it's meant for short-lived data.
*   **Access Pattern:** You can only access the top of the stack.

**What lives on the stack?**
*   Local variables of simple types (`int`, `bool`, pointers).
*   Function call information (arguments, return address).
*   Structs and arrays, if they are of a known, fixed size at compile time and don't "escape."

---

### The Heap: Slower, Flexible, and Long-Lived

The heap is a large, less organized region of memory used for data that needs to live longer than a single function call.

**Analogy:** Think of the heap as a **large, open warehouse**.
*   When you need to store something, you ask the warehouse manager (the Go runtime) for some space.
*   The manager finds a free spot and gives you the address.
*   This space can be of any size and can exist for as long as you need it.
*   When you're done, the **Garbage Collector** is the cleanup crew that comes around to find and throw away things that are no longer being used.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Slower Allocation:** Allocating memory on the heap is more complex. The runtime has to find a suitable free block of memory, which takes more time than just bumping a stack pointer.
*   **Garbage Collected:** The heap is managed by Go's garbage collector (GC). The GC's job is to find objects on the heap that are no longer referenced and free that memory.
*   **Dynamic Size:** The heap can grow as your application needs more memory.
*   **Use Case:** For data that needs to be shared between functions or goroutines, or whose size is not known at compile time.

### Escape Analysis: The Deciding Factor

So how does Go decide whether to put a variable on the stack or the heap? The Go compiler performs a process called **escape analysis**.

The compiler analyzes your code to determine if a variable's lifetime is confined to its function.
*   If a variable is only ever used within the function it was created in, it **does not escape** and can be safely allocated on the **stack**.
*   If the compiler cannot prove that a variable's use is confined to its function (e.g., you return a pointer to it, or it's used in a closure that outlives the function), the variable **escapes** and must be allocated on the **heap**.

**Example:**

```go
package main

// This function returns a pointer to its local variable `x`.
// The compiler sees that `&x` will be used after `createUser` returns.
// Therefore, `x` "escapes" to the heap.
func createUser() *User {
	x := User{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
	return &x
}

// In this function, the variable `y` is only used locally.
// It does not escape and will be allocated on the stack.
func processUser() {
	y := User{Name: "Bob", Age: 25}
	// ... do something with y ...
}

type User struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}
```

You can see this in action by running the compiler with the `-m` flag:
`go build -gcflags="-m" ./main.go`

The output will show you which variables were moved to the heap.
